# Assignment #4 - RYU Shortest Path Packet Forwarding

SDN controller is the brain of the network. It is essential for the SDN network controller to have complete view of the underlying network in the form a topology. With the obtained network topology information, network application developers can implement network applications such as routing, firewall, packet forwarding etc.
In previous assignments, you created a network topology using Mininet API and implemented RYU topology application for gathering networking topology.

In this assignment, you are asked to extend your RYU topology application with shortest path packet forwarding capability based on Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm with link delay as the cost.
