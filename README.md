# Spring-2021-ITCS-8166-ComputerCommNetworks

This repository contains the assignments of course "ITCS 8166: Computer Comm & Networks". This course has been taken in Spring 2021 semester, as part of my PhD degree at UNC Charlotte.

There were four programming assignments in this course. The ultimate goal of these assignments was to build a network topology using Mininet API [(Assignment #2 - Mininet API)](https://github.com/biqar/Spring-2021-ITCS-8166-ComputerCommNetworks/tree/main/assignments/assignment-2) and implement RYU topology application [(Assignment #3 - RYU Topology)](https://github.com/biqar/Spring-2021-ITCS-8166-ComputerCommNetworks/tree/main/assignments/assignment-3) with shortest path packet forwarding capability based on Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm [(Assignment #4 - RYU Shortest Path Packet Forwarding)](https://github.com/biqar/Spring-2021-ITCS-8166-ComputerCommNetworks/tree/main/assignments/assignment-4).
